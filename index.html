            <h3>About Me</h3>
            <p>Born and raised in Cape Girardeau, Missouri on March 12, 1993, 
                A.G. Green II always had a natural affinity for computers and tech.
                As a teenager, he wanted to become a video game developer, but
                never pursued it.17 long years later Anthony has now found
                his passion and purpose. Anthony specializes in helping clients solve
                problems and find solutions using not just his software engineering
                skills and ability to interpret complex programming builds, but
                he also uses his in depth communication skills to meet customer
                satisfaction and understands the right terminology to use when
                communicating with a team of fellow Developers.</p>
